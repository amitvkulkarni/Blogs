The G7 is a club of Western nations (with Japan given that status as an ally of the West and a major economy) that have dominated the world and its institutions, in some cases for centuries, and retain the ambition to maintain that position by policy coordination amongst themselves and by co-opting rising powers, including India, given the shifts in global power in recent decades.

The G7 recognised that they could not manage the 2008 financial crisis on their own and needed a wider international partnership, but one under their aegis. With this in mind, the G20 forum hitherto at the finance minister level was raised to the summit level. The G20 agenda is, however, shifting increasingly towards the interests and priorities of the developing countries (now being referred to as the Global South). During India’s G20 presidency, with India holding the Voice of the Global South summits before presiding over the G20 and at the conclusion of its work, and with the inclusion of the African Union as a G20 permanent member at India’s initiative, the pro-Global South content of the G20 agenda has got consolidated.

Both the G7 and the G20, however, face challenges from other platforms for consensus-building on global issues. BRICS, a group of non-Western countries, is getting expanded to resist the hegemony of the West that is still expressing itself in the form of sanctions, the weaponising of finance, regime change policies and double standards in addressing issues of democracy and human rights etc. An expanded BRICS will rival both the G7 and the G20 as a platform for promoting multipolarity, a greater role of developing countries in global governance, more equity in international relations, and introducing much-needed reforms in the international system.
