        "The performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is crucial in the evolving AI landscape. These systems blend retrieval and generation capabilities, requiring accuracy and efficiency in handling diverse queries. The challenge lies in finding a balance between retrieving precise information and understanding complex questions, requiring advanced retrieval methods to push AI’s boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "EnsembleRetriever is an innovative method to improve RAG system performance by combining the strengths of various retrieval algorithms. It integrates results from different retrievers and reranks them using the Reciprocal Rank Fusion algorithm, prioritizing the most relevant documents. This approach leverages the strengths of both sparse and dense retrievers, making the system more robust and effective."

During India's G20 presidency, the pro-Global South content of the G20 agenda has gained significance. These countries are seeking a wider international partnership, but under their leadership.
