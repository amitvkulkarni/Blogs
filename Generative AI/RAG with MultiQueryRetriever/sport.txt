Rohit Sharma said he needed "to be smart" and "open up all sides of the field" to counter the strong breeze at the Daren Sammy Stadium in a Super Eight game of the T20 World Cup 2024 against an Australia bowling attack that tried to use that same breeze to make life difficult for him. He was smart enough on the day, hitting a 41-ball 92 with seven fours and eight sixes to lead India to a 24-run win and a spot in the semi-finals as the Group 1 toppers.

"I thought right from over number one, there was a strong breeze blowing across. But they changed their plan, trying to bowl against the breeze," Rohit said on the host broadcast after earning the Player-of-the-Match award. "So I had to open up the other side of the field as well. Need to be smart. Like I said, we need to be smart when we play. And that is something that I was backing myself to do."

"It is quite satisfying, especially when you play like that," Rohit said about beating Australia. "We know the opposition and the threat that they bring with them as well. But I thought overall, as a team, we played well. We kept doing the things that we are supposed to do, and what we know the best. And yeah, we can take a lot of confidence from a game like that."
